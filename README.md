# Database Migration Automation Demo

This project demonstrates a robust database migration automation pipeline with the following features:

## Key Features
- 🔄 Automated Migration Testing
- 🗃️ Temporary Test Database Creation
- 💾 Backup Verification
- ↩️ Automated Rollback Procedures
- 📊 Performance Impact Analysis

## Project Structure

```

## How It Works

1. **Migration Process**
   - Developers create new migrations in `migrations/versions/`
   - CI pipeline automatically creates a test database
   - Migrations are applied and verified
   - Performance impact is measured

2. **Testing Strategy**
   - Each migration is tested in isolation
   - Full migration chain is verified
   - Rollback procedures are validated
   - Performance benchmarks are compared

3. **Backup Verification**
   - Automated backup before each migration
   - Backup integrity verification
   - Restore testing in isolated environment

4. **Performance Monitoring**
   - Query performance before/after migration
   - Index usage analysis
   - Transaction throughput testing
   - Resource utilization monitoring

## Getting Started

1. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

2. Configure your database:
   ```bash
   cp config/database.yml.example config/database.yml
   ```

3. Run the test suite:
   ```bash
   python -m pytest tests/
   ```
